# The History Movie Index

## Overall Project:

This website was created to help teachers, students and parents alike to find movies set in specific time periods. In this website, each movie is classed according to the veracity and accuracy of the story it's telling.

## Goal:

21st century is a digital media and books do not have to be the only source of information. 

I believe maintsream media can help young generations (and older) visualize time periods so far out of reach. Thus, helping them memorize key characters and events of our History. 

By making the distinction between "what's real" and "what's imagined", this website will help anchor these viewers in the reality instead of the fantasy.
